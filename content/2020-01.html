    title: "Operationalising Responsible AI"
    subtitle: "Recent advancements in the area of artificial intelligence and the exponential growth in the technologies supporting this area has led to a proliferation in the number of use-cases of artificial intelligence in various areas ranging from health, retail, travel to humanitarian assistance, drone for social good and space exploration. It has also resulted in a large discourse around the potential harms, intentional and unintentional, that the algorithms and AI can cause. The public discourse has, however, remained largely policy-oriented. In this talk, we will share our experience of building responsible AI systems with evolutionary architecture that have responsibility built in their core."
