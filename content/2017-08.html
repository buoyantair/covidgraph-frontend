    title: "An introduction to GraphQL"
    subtitle: "In this talk, we will explore the basics of GraphQL and understand the problems that it solves. We will also understand primary constructs of GraphQL - query, mutation and subscription. We’ll briefly explore the ecosystem around GraphQL and get started by building a very basic TODO example to get your GraphQL buds warmed up. We’ll end the talk by comparing GraphQL with REST and suggest where each of these architectural patterns can be used in your application stack."
