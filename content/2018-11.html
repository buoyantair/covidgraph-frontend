    title: "Role of AI & ML in Beauty Care Industry"
    subtitle: "The session intends to briefly explain the difference and relation between the terms AI and ML in general and then move to a more detailed discussion of their role in the Beauty and Cosmetics industry. What were some of the pain points and challenges that the Beauty care industry was dealing with, how did AI and ML help solve some of those issues eventually helping the businesses increase sales through a greater trust of the consumers and a statistically backed validation of beauty products before launching them into the market. With more and more products moving to the eCommerce platforms and thereby reaching out to a larger mass, a personalized buying experience becomes the key factor in converting a casual visitor into a permanent and repeating buyer. With the help of AI and ML technologies, businesses have been able to achieve that and are constantly innovating to empower their research and sales processes further."
