    title: "Testing strategies in Microservices"
    subtitle: "Microservice architecture is a popular solution to address scalability challenges that often come with monolithic applications. But it comes with its own challenges, including testing.

Does the traditional testing pyramid apply to microservices? What do unit tests mean, when a microservice has become the new unit? What types of tests are more relevant to microservices? How do we test on local development machines? We will try to answer these based on our experience with microservices projects at ThoughtWorks."
