    title: "Breaking down a Monolith"
    subtitle: "The DevOps revolution has enabled automation of infrastructure to a level unseen before. Microservices are a new breed of applications that are flourishing in the DevOps age. Microservices make businesses more agile. They have well defined scopes, smaller independent teams and faster feedback cycles. They lead to more scalable, maintainable and fault tolerant systems. Breaking up a monolith into microservices is a journey. There are phases where the modern system has to coexist with the legacy system.

Is your application a monolith? Do you think microservices is the way to go? In this talk, we will try to throw some light on those questions and share our experiences."
