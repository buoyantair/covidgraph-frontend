    title: "Design, Lean Agile Thinking"
    subtitle: "For building the successful products or offering the services to a customer often we end up with the discussions on what practices should we adopt. The recent buzz words in this space are being Design Thinking, Lean Thinking and Agile Thinking. But there are always confusions, contradictions and long unending discussions on what we should adapt. This session aims to address this key question.
The session will discuss about each thinking process and what offering do they provide in addressing the problems/solutions that we build for the customers. Case studies will be presented and discussed to understand the benefits of each thinking and how it enabled to turn the failures to success."
