    title: "Software developers guide to world of Modelling and Simulations"
    subtitle: "What would have happened if only â‚¹1000 notes were demonetised? What if unknown Ebola strain emerges in Mumbai? What if Hyderabad Municipal corporation decides to ban private diesel vehicles? As testing these scenarios is infeasible, the only way to understand the impact and support decision making is via simulations.
</br>Computer Simulations are controlled environments, where experts can build models representing complex systems, and try out various what-if scenarios like above. Being virtual, the simulations are economically feasible and socially safer.
</br>Most of these models are composed of many subsystems, and in addition being resource intensive, therefore the development of such simulation models is non trivial.
</br></br>In this talk, we will introduce you to the discipline of Modelling and Simulation and its use cases.
</br>We will further discuss how we can represent these models using software engineering principles and run them effectively using computer science techniques like parallel and distributed computing in languages and frameworks like Rust, NetLogo, GAMA, Gazebo, ROS."
