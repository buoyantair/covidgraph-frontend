    title: "Social Media Risk Communication & #Elections2019"
    subtitle: "<p>Selfies have become a prominent medium for self-portrayal onsocial media. Unfortunately, certain social media users go to extreme lengths to click selfies, which puts their lives at risk. 230+ individuals have died since March 2014 until January 2019 while trying to click selfies. We have been curating selfie deaths, building technologies to nudge users while taking dangerous selfies, e.g. Location Marker Saftie <a>https://www.facebook.com/saftiebot/</a> and a camera Saftie Camera <a>http://bit.ly/saftie-cam.</a> We have made all the data and code that we have built public at <a>http://labs.precog.iiitd.edu.in/killfie/</a> More recently we have started analysing distracted driving using Snapchat and we are in the process of characterising the problem. Will discuss about these risk communication efforts that we are pursuing through the social media content. </p> </br>

<p>Social Media, today, is playing a very important role in the politics of almost every nation. In India, there has been a boom in social media political campaigns, which was more marked in the 2014 General Elections. We are building a  portal <a>http://bit.ly/elections19</a> to analyze the 2019 data and help see through the data that is getting generated on social media. We are finding some interesting patterns, one of them being sharp raise and fall of the followers <a>http://precog.iiitd.edu.in/blog/2019/02/08/twitters-suspect-users-affects-indian-political-handles/</a> You can find all our blogs on this topic at <a>http://precog.iiitd.edu.in/blog/</a> We have been live blogging on the different phases of Elections Phase 5: <a>http://bit.ly/phase5-liveblog</a> Phase 4: <a>http://bit.ly/phase4-liveblog</a> Please change the URL number 3, 2, 1 and see the rest of the blogs.
