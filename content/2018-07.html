    title: "Browser Bulks Up, Server Slims Down,Creeping Cloud Complexity and much more..."
    subtitle: "This time we have a four fold agenda. <br>
The talk will consist of:<br>
--> The need for better user experiences continues to push functionality into the browser, and many back-end services become thinner and less complex as a result.<br>
--> While organizations continue to mature in their use of cloud technologies, an inevitable creeping complexity always accompanies building real solutions with these new pieces.<br>
--> We see a shift in the traditional 'lock everything down globally' approach to a more nuanced, localized approach. We welcome this shift, especially when tools and automation can ensure equal or better compliance.<br>
--> The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem continues to evolve at a steady and strong pace and includes critical success factors such as security and maturing engineering practices."
