    title: "Evolution of Voice"
    subtitle: "The talk is about Evolving Interactions. It talks about how voice as a input changing the game. How Amazon Alexa, Google home, cotona are paving a path towards a world where your voice commands are gonna change the way you look at the world. We would explain the few use cases with a demo on how it is shaping and we would also want to show how to do that on a we will use Alexa to do this.
With the recent google I/O conference and Microsoft Build 2018 - Vision Keynote it is made evident that the big players are using voice to do much more than what we think today, while we know that it is happening we need to understand the domain and improve our thought process to be the early adopters and put our clients at a better place.
    <br> We will be talking about two parts of the whole game:<br>
    --> How smart homes and IOT are gonna grow and take place with these evolutions.<br>
    --> How products are gonna shape and can utilize this interaction to stay competitive in the market."
