    title: "Literate Programming with Emacs Org-mode"
    subtitle: "Literate Programming is about creating narratives. Programs are part of the narrative. Invented by Donald Knuth in the 1970's, literate programming inverts the idea of code and comments. Rather than comments supporting code, we now have code supporting a narrative.
</br>Key Learnings:</br>
* Introduction to emacs Org-mode</br>
* How to do multi-language literate programming using Org-mode </br>
No prior knowledge of Emacs is necessary. However, if you come to the talk with a laptop, please make sure Emacs and Org-mode are installed on it."
