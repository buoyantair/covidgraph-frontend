    title: "HTTP2"
    subtitle: "The web has dramatically evolved over the last 20+ years, yet HTTP - the workhorse of the Web - has not. Web developers have worked around HTTP's limitations, but:<br />
--> Performance still falls short of full bandwidth utilization<br />
--> Web design and maintenance are more complex<br />
--> Resource consumption increases for client and server<br />
--> Cacheability of resources suffers<br />
HTTP/2 attempts to solve many of the shortcomings and inflexibilities of HTTP/1.1."
