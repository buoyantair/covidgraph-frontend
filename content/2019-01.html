    title: "Community Wi-Fi Networks Using FreedomBox"
    subtitle: "The session will introduce the concept of connected-cars and showcase aucovei 'Autonomous and Connected Vehicle' which is capable of driving itself autonomously through a set of waypoints and reach the set destination. aucovei is loaded with a wide variety of features like live video streaming, voice commands, cloud connectivity, machine learning based sign detection, etc. to address many real-world use cases. The session will also cover the architecture and schematics of the hardware and cloud components which constitutes this solution.

The Telugu villages of Gangadevipalli and Surappagudem have free community Wi-Fi and locally-hosted digital services available to all. The network is neutral, privacy-respecting, inclusive and self-funded by the villagers. It's cheap, quick to deploy and costs very little to maintain. This is not a multi-crore government project or a data-harvesting corporate program. The network was built by volunteers using off-the-shelf hardware and is powered by freedom-respecting software running on the FreedomBox platform. In this talk, we present an inspiring story of how a group of volunteer hackers using technologies from various engineering disciplines helped create a solution to bring rural India online through local self-reliance instead of depending on governments or corporations."
