    title: "Event Driven Architectures: Why, When and How"
    subtitle: "The Businesses are becoming disruptive and so are the enterprises, which are trying to adapt technology that can keep them ahead of the competition. The Micro services Architecture has transformed businesses to operate at scale, and helped business domains aka sub systems to grow independently. However, it didn't eliminate the challenge of dependency among subsystems, it just elevated the dependency within a system to the dependency over multiple sub systems. In this talk we will share our experience building event driven micro services and how they help in building fault tolerant, loosely coupled systems. We will also highlight some good practices, anti patterns and different models in event driven architectures."
