    title: "End to end (E2E) cross browser testing with Testcafé"
    subtitle: "With the continuous evolution of technologies and frequency of releases for web applications in the market, stability and testing of the application becomes utmost important. With the increase in complexity of the system, test automation is becoming the DNA of the application development. Supporting multiple browsers is one of the key to cater to a larger audience. Cross browser and end to end workflow testing is getting increased demand.<br>
E2E tests allow you test your application from start to finish, in ways an end user would use the application. Unit and integration tests test a pieces of code in isolation and cannot guarantee that all the pieces would work as a system.<br>
Testcafé is one of the recent arrivals in this evolution which makes testing easy in these aspect. Developer friendly, with awesomeness of Javascript library and no selenium dependency makes the tool more special. The session is to emphasize on the need to write E2E test automations and to demonstrate the architecture and uses of Testcafé."
