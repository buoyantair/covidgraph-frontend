    title: "Building Cloud Native Applications Using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud"
    subtitle: "Nowadays enterprises as well as startups are looking to build their software applications leveraging Cloud Platforms so that they can greatly reduce their go to market time and infrastructure setup costs. However, Cloud Native Applications (NCA) should be designed with cloud computing architecture in mind which involves thinking about dynamic provisioning of resources, service downtimes, data redundancy etc. Spring Boot provides a robust platform for building microservices and Spring Cloud provides the capabilities to build Cloud Native Applications by abstracting the low level details. In this talk, we will learn how to develop Cloud Native Applications using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud frameworks."
