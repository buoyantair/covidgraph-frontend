    title: "Experience Design & User Experience"
    subtitle: "Often we see our colleagues/people mentioning a lot about UX, but then do they really know what UX is all about? Often I also see them mentioning “Do you know UI/UX?” or “That person is a UI/UX” and I go, really? UI/UX? And when you ask them the difference, only a few are near to differentiate between them. This problem is not cleared and now we have a new role “XD”. Ok, now XD and UX, hmmm the same? No! Poles apart, but a family. Really?
</br>I have my experiences to share on these two. So come along, Let’s talk, discuss and share all viewpoints and see how we can teach each other and learn about how different or same these two are.
</br>Mind you this is not something where we would be making statements as to what’s right or what’s wrong, but, for you to decide where you are and what would you want to do, now that you know what these are and it’s function and, how you can start using them in your projects.

</br>Key Learnings:</br>
* What is Experience Design?</br>
* What is User Experience Design?</br>
* What is involved?</br>
* Tools that can be used?</br>
* How do I measure the quality?</br>"
