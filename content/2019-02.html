    title: "Metaprogramming in Ruby"
    subtitle: "The session is to give you a taste of the meta programming capabilities in Ruby and provide you with enough foundation so you can start applying these techniques in your day-to-day work.
Ruby is an object oriented language designed to optimize programmer happiness. The programming constructs in Ruby are inspired from Smalltalk, Lisp and Perl. Ruby is an interpreted language and has an interactive REPL named irb (interactive ruby) which helps in quick experimentation and documentation lookup.

Ruby is a dynamically typed language that encourages developers to write clean code by leveraging its dynamic nature. Clean code is simple and intent revealing code that is written in the language of the problem domain. In this talk we will look at the Ruby Object Model, Method lookup, Blocks, Classes and Code that writes code. We will look at some practical examples where metaprogramming can help remove duplication and solve problems in simple and elegant ways."
